Question: Alternatively, to compare items in the cart, instead of using the Comparator class I have
mentioned, you can use the Comparable interface1 and override the compareTo()method. You can
refer to the Java docs to see the information of this interface.
Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
- What class should implement the Comparable interface?
- In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo()method to reflect the ordering that
we want?
- Can we have two ordering rules of the item (by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this
Comparable interface approach?
- Suppose the DVDs have a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then
decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
